#### Options ####
Click the M above the backpack button (bottom-right of the main actionbar) to open theme and display options. modui is designed to be modular and the different elements of the UI can be turned on and off.

#### FAQ ####
Q: Why aren't my target and nameplate casting timers correct?

A: Blizzard recently disabled accurate timer checking in their classic API in the run up to release, so now its no longer possible to check which spell rank is being used - so modui has to assume its the highest rank with the longest spell cast time for now.

#### To-do ####
- Combat Text
- PvP and Battleground support.
- Raid Frames (?)
- Other stuff i forgot about since I last worked on this thing.
