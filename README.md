#### FAQ ####
Q: I'm getting an error that says something about MODUI_VAR.

A: try reloading the UI (type: _/rl_) and then deleting your cache before making an issue, particularly if you've recently used an older version of modui.



Q: The UI won't load in my game!

A: Make sure you're putting the directory in _WoW/Classic/Interface/AddOns/_, then rename the folder from *TheNightIsDarkUI-master* to *TheNightIsDarkUI*.



Q: Why aren't my target and nameplate casting timers correct?

A: Blizzard recently disabled accurate timer checking in their classic API in the run up to release, so now its no longer possible to check which spell rank is being used - so modui has to assume its the highest rank with the longest spell cast time for now.



Q: I don't want a black UI, how do I change it back to normal?

A: Open the theme option by hitting the *M* above the bag button or typing _/modui_, then choose *UI Colour*. Hit *Reset To Default* or move the colour wheel picker to white and hit Okay.

#### To-do ####
